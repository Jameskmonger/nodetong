### `git commit -m "oji"`
Pardon the pun - let's use an emoji or ten at the start of each commit message as a nice way to tag the commit. Here are a couple we've come up with so far.

#### Commit types
* :gift: - `:gift:` - new feature
* :poop: - `:poop:` - fixed a bug
* :lipstick: - `:lipstick:` - refactoring
* :memo: - `:memo:` - adding documentation

#### Areas
* :eyes: - `:eyes:` - graphics
* :phone: - `:phone:` - networking (this used to be :globe_with_meridians: but it was far too long)
* :racehorse: - `:racehorse:` - performance
* :lock: - `:lock:` - security

#### Smash it!
* :+1: - `:+1:` - nice!
* :fire: - `:fire:` - on fire!
